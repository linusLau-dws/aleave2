## Coding guide
### iOS
The app is written in Swift 4.

To add a string, always use `NSLocalizedString(key, comment)` for translation. To add a formatted string, wrap the `NSLocalizedString` inside `String(format: <NSLocalizedString>, CVarArg...)`.

### Android
The app is written in Java.

To add a string, always use `getString(R.string.some_string, arg0, arg1, arg2...)`.

## Dependencies
### iOS
The iOS app employs [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/), a popular package manager for iOS. A new machine should have it installed first:
```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
It is very important to open the **.workspace file on XCode, NOT .xcodeproj** .

The project dependent on the following libraries, as listed in the Podfile:
-	[AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), analogous to Volley on Android, for sending network requests
-	[DropDown](https://github.com/AssistoLab/DropDown), since UIKit does not have built-in drop downs
-	[FMDB](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb), implementation of SQLite on iOS
-	[NMessenger](https://github.com/eBay/NMessenger), which provides the GUI for messaging
-	[SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON), for creating and accessing JSON objects using subscript syntax

### Android

The project dependent on the following libraries, as listed in the Podfile:

-	[Volley](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html), analogous to AlamoFire on iOS
-	[Android-Bootstrap](https://github.com/Bearded-Hen/Android-Bootstrap), UI components

I maintain two libraries myself on GitHub:

-	[TableView for Android](https://github.com/SoftFeta/TableView)
-	[ChatView for Android](https://github.com/SoftFeta/ChatView)

## Building
Before building, update the version number in AndroidManifest.xml / .xcodeproj AND the SQL Server table t_Metadata using 
```sql
UPDATE t_Metadata SET [Value] = '<new version number>' WHERE [Key] = 'VERSION_NUMBER'
```
If local (SQLite) schema changed, use the onUpdate function of SQLHelper / FMDB on iOS to patch it.

### iOS

### Android

1.	Open Android Studio, select `Build` > `Generate Signed Bundle / APKâ€¦`

2.	Choose Android App Bundle if you wish to upload the app to Play Store, otherwise select APK.
 
3.	The .jks key store file is inside the same project. Locate it and put its path into the dialog. The key store password and key password are both `dw@4ndr01d`.

4.	Choose release for Build Type and click Finish.

5.	A dialog will appear at the bottom right corner of the screen. Click locate to open the container folder.
